# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in C++

A comprehensive collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) implemented in C++.

## What is DSA?

### 1. Data Structures (DS)
A **data structure** is a way of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Different types of data structures are used based on the nature of the problem being solved.  

#### Types of Data Structures
- **Linear Data Structures**: Data is arranged in a sequential manner.  
  - **Arrays** – Collection of elements stored in contiguous memory.  
  - **Linked Lists** – Collection of nodes where each node points to the next one.  
  - **Stacks** – Follows LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle.  
  - **Queues** – Follows FIFO (First In, First Out) principle.  

- **Non-Linear Data Structures**: Data is not stored sequentially.  
  - **Trees** – Hierarchical structure where elements are stored as parent-child relationships.  
  - **Graphs** – Collection of nodes connected by edges, used to represent networks.  
  - **Hash Tables** – Used for fast lookups using key-value pairs.  

### 2. Algorithms (A)
An **algorithm** is a step-by-step procedure or formula for solving a problem. Algorithms are implemented using data structures to optimize performance.  

#### Types of Algorithms
- **Sorting Algorithms**  
  - Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort  
- **Searching Algorithms**  
  - Linear Search, Binary Search  
- **Recursion & Backtracking**  
  - Factorial, Tower of Hanoi, N-Queens Problem  
- **Graph Algorithms**  
  - Depth First Search (DFS), Breadth First Search (BFS), Dijkstra’s Algorithm  
- **Dynamic Programming (DP)**  
  - Fibonacci Sequence, Knapsack Problem, Longest Common Subsequence  

### Why is DSA Important?
1. **Efficient Code** – Helps in writing optimized and scalable code.  
2. **Competitive Programming** – Essential for coding challenges and contests.  
3. **Technical Interviews** – Almost every software engineering interview includes DSA questions.  
4. **Real-World Applications** – Used in databases, AI, networking, game development, etc.
